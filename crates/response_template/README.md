# smg-response-template

A Rust port of the response-template parser of Hugging Face transformers
(`transformers.utils.chat_parsing`, release 5.17.0). A checkpoint can describe
in the `response_template` of its `tokenizer_config.json` how its output splits
into message fields (`thinking`, `content`, `tool_calls`, ...). This crate loads
such a template and parses model output with it, streaming or at once, and
returns what transformers returns: the same keys in the same order, the same
strings, ints kept apart from floats, floats bit for bit, and the same region
events for the same chunks.

A template this crate would not parse exactly as transformers does is refused
when it loads (`LoadError::Unsupported`, naming the construct), never parsed
differently. Callers can then fall back to another parser.

## API

| transformers 5.17.0 | this crate |
|---|---|
| `ResponseParser(template, prefix=..., tools=...)` | `ResponseParser::new(&template, prefix, &tools)` |
| `.initial_events`, `.feed(text)`, `.finalize()` | `initial_events()`, `feed(text)`, `finalize(self)` |
| `parse_response(text, template, prefix=..., tools=...)` | `parse_response(text, &template, prefix, &tools)` |
| `load_response_template(dict)` | `load_response_template(&serde_json::Value)` |
| `ResponseTemplate.truncate_past_last_anchor` | `ResponseTemplate::truncate_past_last_anchor` |
| event dicts / message dict | `Event` (serializes to the same dicts) / `Message` |
| `ValueError` while loading | `LoadError::Invalid` |
| exceptions while parsing | `ParseError` (`Content { kind, .. }` names the Python class) |

`prefix` is required as in transformers; pass `""` to opt out. `finalize`
consumes the parser, so the `RuntimeError`s of feeding or finalizing twice
cannot happen. Results match transformers' for a template `Value` equal to
what Python's `json.loads` returns; serde_json reads some float literals, and
integers beyond u64, differently. The files follow transformers' layout:
`response_templates.rs`, `response_parser.rs` and `content_parsers.rs` port
the files of the same names, keeping their function names and statement
order. `pyre.rs` stands in for the `regex` module and `py.rs` for the Python
built-ins the parser applies to model output (`str.strip`, `int`, `float`,
`json.loads`). As in transformers, every `feed` searches the text not yet
committed again, so a stream costs time quadratic in how much text stays
uncommitted.

## Regular expressions

transformers compiles patterns with the `regex` module, and streaming depends on
its `search(..., partial=True)`, whose results come from the module's matcher
rather than from the pattern's language. `pyre.rs` parses the constructs used
by the templates of transformers' tests and of `transformers serve` and by the
public checkpoint shapes the parity fixtures record, plus positive classes and
ranges in classes (as in tool-name patterns like `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`),
and runs them on a backtracking matcher that reproduces those results.
Supported:

- literal characters, `\` before ASCII punctuation, `\n`;
- `.` (transformers sets `DOTALL`), `\w`, `\s` (with the `regex` module's
  Unicode tables), `[...]` and `[^...]` of literal characters and ranges of
  them (`-` is literal only as the last item);
- `^`, `$`, `\Z`, `\b`;
- `(?:...)`, `(?P<name>...)`, alternation;
- `*`, `+`, `?` after one character, `?` after a group; `*?` after one
  character, in open and close patterns only as `.*?` before a literal, or
  after another item and before `\b` and a literal (other positions change
  what a partial search reports);
- `\1` to `\9` in start anchors and tag patterns.

Anything else is refused, for example look-around, inline flags, `{m,n}`,
possessive and other lazy quantifiers, `\d`, unnamed groups, and backreferences
in open and close patterns. So are alternatives two of which can end in a
negated class of one character (the `regex` module merges them into one class
and matches `[^a]|[^b]` as `[^ab]`), and a backreference inside an optional
group (the module does not retry the group where it failed before, even when
the group it refers to has changed since).

## Other templates refused when they load

- A start anchor or tag pattern that can match the empty string, or a field
  whose open and close patterns can both match it (transformers can loop
  forever there).
- `content_args` that transformers only reads while parsing and that fail
  there or depend on Python typing: not a dict, a `value_parser` that is not a
  dict naming a known parser, a `string_delims` that is not a list of pairs of
  non-empty strings, an empty or non-string `line_sep` or `kv_sep`, a
  non-string `tag_pattern`, a `key` or `value` group a match can leave unset.
- A value transformers stores in two places and then changes in place: a list
  in `defaults` for a repeated field without `join` (transformers appends to
  the template's own list, so it grows from one parse to the next), or a
  transform that uses the parsed content, or an item of it, at two paths where
  one contains the other (casting tool-call arguments changes both).

## Known differences

Both raise an explicit error where transformers returns a value:

- A value JSON cannot hold (NaN, an infinity, an integer outside i64 and u64, a
  string with a lone surrogate): `ParseError::Unrepresentable`, from the call
  whose events or message would carry it. A lone surrogate is parsed into a
  private-use character (from U+F0000 or U+100000 on), so a JSON text that
  also holds one of those characters and gives a key holding it twice raises
  it too, even where transformers then drops the value.
- JSON nested 512 deep: `ParseError::Content` with `PyErrorKind::Recursion`.
  Python raises `RecursionError` only near its C recursion limit, about 10,000
  levels.

## Parity tests

`scripts/generate_hf_fixtures.py` runs transformers itself and records what it
returns in `tests/fixtures/hf/`: every parser session of transformers' own tests
(`tests/utils/test_chat_parsing.py` at tag v5.17.0), the templates built into
`transformers serve`, templates with the shapes of public checkpoints written
with neutral markers, prompts for these templates that end inside a region, a
delimiter or the start anchor (with and without tools), rules of loading and
parsing, seeded random templates and sessions, regex rows for every pattern of
that corpus, for Python-dialect details and for random patterns, and the Python
built-ins and character tables the port reproduces. The tests
replay each session whole, at every two-way split and in recorded chunkings,
and compare values and event traces. `tests/unsupported.tsv` lists the
recorded templates transformers accepts and this crate refuses, with the
reason; the test fails when that changes in either direction.

To regenerate (Python 3.12):

```bash
pip install -r crates/response_template/scripts/requirements.txt
git clone --depth 1 --branch v5.17.0 https://github.com/huggingface/transformers /tmp/transformers
python crates/response_template/scripts/generate_hf_fixtures.py --transformers-src /tmp/transformers
cargo test -p smg-response-template
```

`--check` fails when the committed fixtures are stale (CI runs it when the
generator or the fixtures change). `--extra-cases FILE --out DIR` records local
cases and `--fuzz N --out DIR` random ones; run the tests on them with
`RESPONSE_TEMPLATE_HF_FIXTURES=DIR`.

To move to a newer transformers: pin it in `scripts/requirements.txt` and in the
generator, regenerate, review the fixture diff, adjust the port, and update
`TRANSFORMERS_VERSION` in `tests/hf_parity.rs`.

//! Worker Registry for multi-router support
//!
//! Provides centralized registry for workers with model-based indexing.
//!
//! # Performance Optimizations
//! The model index uses immutable Arc snapshots instead of RwLock for lock-free reads.
//! This is critical for high-concurrency scenarios where many requests query the same model.
//!
//! # Consistent Hash Ring
//! The registry maintains a pre-computed [`HashRing`] per model for O(log n)
//! consistent hashing. The ring is rebuilt only when workers are added or
//! removed, not per request. See [`crate::worker::hash_ring`] for the ring
//! itself — this file only wires registry events to ring rebuilds.

///   count, is what sets the wait under size-skewed traffic: a long prompt is
///   far more work than a short one, regardless of how many requests are queued.
/// - `inflight_tokens` — token-work this router has dispatched to the worker
///   since its last load poll. Polls are stale between intervals; without this
///   correction, plain argmin sends a whole interval's arrivals to one worker
///   (incast). Crediting each dispatch water-fills load across workers instead.
/// - `/ throughput` — normalizes work to *time*, comparing heterogeneous
///   workers by drain time rather than raw token count.
/// - `k / (1 − k)` — the M/M/1 expected-occupancy barrier on KV utilization
///   `k`; convex and divergent at the KV cliff, so routing avoids the
///   preemption/recompute that begins as KV fills.
///
/// Both terms are in seconds, so they add directly. Missing signals degrade
/// gracefully and stay in time units:
/// - no queued-token report (backend exposes a queue depth but not its token
///   count, as Prometheus-gauge backends do): the queue is estimated at
///   `waiting_reqs · p̄`, keeping the queue visible in time units rather than
///   scoring a backlogged worker as idle. Only a backend reporting neither
///   scores `queued_tokens = 0`;
/// - zero/absent throughput (backend reports no generation rate): falls back to
///   the configured `default_throughput`, so the work term stays in seconds and
///   the KV barrier stays relevant;
/// - a worker with no fresh snapshot while peers report: its live in-flight is
///   converted to a drain-time estimate (`load · p̄ / fleet_nominal_throughput`)
///   so it is comparable to reporting workers, not scored on a raw count;
/// - the whole fleet dark (true cold start, or a backend that never reports
///   loads): join-shortest-queue on the live in-flight count.
///
/// In-flight token-work is exact on the gRPC routing path (the request's token
/// count is known at selection); the HTTP path has no token count and falls
/// back to `p̄ · count`, which is weaker on size-skewed traffic. This policy is
/// therefore intended for gRPC workers.
///
/// # Tuning knobs
///
/// All are fields of `PolicyConfig::LeastLoad` with the defaults below:
/// - `kv_pressure_weight` (λ_t, default `0.15` s) — weight of the KV-pressure
///   barrier. Raise it to steer harder away from near-full KV; lower it to
///   weight raw drain time more.
/// - `default_throughput` (default `2000` tok/s) — drain rate used when a
///   backend reports no live `gen_throughput`. Set it to the fleet's measured
///   per-replica generation rate; it co-tunes with `kv_pressure_weight`.
/// - `mean_prefill_tokens` (p̄, default `1024`) — per-request token estimate for
///   the in-flight term when the request's token count is unknown at routing
///   (the HTTP path; ignored when tokens are known, i.e. gRPC).
/// - `load_check_interval_secs` (default `10`) — worker-load poll period; the
///   in-flight correction absorbs staleness between polls.
/// - `max_waiting_requests` (default `0` = disabled) — per-worker waiting-queue
///   cap: a worker whose reported waiting requests, plus requests dispatched to
///   it since its last poll, have reached the cap is skipped. When every
///   candidate is at the cap the selection returns none, so the request falls
///   to the router's admission queue instead of deepening a backlog. Set it

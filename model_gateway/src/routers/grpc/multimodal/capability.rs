//! Backend x modality capability: the single source of truth for which gRPC
//! engine supports which input modality.
//!
//! Previously this was implicit and duplicated across assembly (per-backend
//! `into_single_image_batch` / `into_single_vision_batch` / ad-hoc `bail!`s with
//! divergent messages). Centralizing it here lets the pipeline reject an
//! unsupported (engine, modality) request at worker selection -- once the
//! runtime is known, before request building assembles the payload -- with one
//! consistent message, and lets assembly assert against the same matrix as
//! defense in depth.

# CI image carrying a fully-built TokenSpeed (engine + kernel + scheduler)
# for the tokenspeed e2e lanes.
#
# The GPU e2e jobs run BARE on the k8s runner pods (no job container —
# vars.SMG_CI_GPU_CONTAINER_IMAGE has never been set, so the container: line
# in e2e-gpu-job.yml resolves to "no container"). This image is therefore a
# CARRIER, not a job container: at job time
# scripts/ci_fetch_tokenspeed_prebuilt.sh pulls it and docker-cp's the baked
# payload onto the runner, where scripts/ci_install_tokenspeed.sh's stamp
# fast path takes over.
#
# Portability contract with the runner (Ubuntu 24.04 pods):
#   - base is ubuntu:24.04 so the baked venv's interpreter symlink resolves
#     to the same /usr/bin path on the runner (the venv-adoption check in
#     ci_setup_python_venv.sh re-validates the interpreter there);
#   - the payload lives under /opt/smg-ci (venv + stamp) and
#     /opt/tokenspeed-src (checkout the venv's editable installs point at),
#     extracted to identical absolute paths;
#   - the CUDA toolkit and the Python dev headers are NOT part of the
#     payload; the install script apt-installs them on the runner when
#     missing, same as the source path.
#
# Built by .github/workflows/ci-tokenspeed-image.yml on every bump of
# .github/versions/tokenspeed.ref or of the image tooling, and tagged
# ghcr.io/<owner>/smg:<tag> with the content-addressed tag printed by
# scripts/ci_tokenspeed_image_tag.sh. The build needs nvcc but no GPU
# (the kernel arch list is pinned in the install script), so it runs on the
# CPU/docker runner pool.
